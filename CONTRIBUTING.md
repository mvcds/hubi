### Roadmap

If you'd like to code some item in particular, take ownership of the item by opening an issue so people will know someone is taking a look at it.

The ones open for immediate contribution through coding are listed under:
- [Must haves](ROADMAP.md#must-haves)
- [Translators](ROADMAP.md#translators)
- [Site Translator](ROADMAP.md#site-translator)

In order to code for what [future releases may have](ROADMAP.md#future-releases-may-have), please explain how you plan to do it, as they have a high product value.

And for [ideas and suggestions](ROADMAP.md#ideas-and-suggestions), you should also explain how you plan to do it and explain whay you think it should be prioritized because there is a reason why they are kept separated.

### My contribution is not on the roadmap

For typos, rephrasings and changes that touch `hubi`'s documentation files, you can open pull requests directly.

If you want to report a bug, an error or discuss why some behavior is not working as you expected, please search if others are facing the same problem, and open an issue if you can't find its solution.

In case you want to code some idea or feature not listed on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), you can issue a pull request adding it to the [ideas and suggestions](ROADMAP.md#ideas-and-suggestions) section. You should name it and provide a short description on the file, in the PR you should explain why that feature matters.

## Other kind of contributions

Open issues, write marvinc.silva@gmail.com, and communicate what you're plannning.
