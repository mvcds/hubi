### You don't need to code to help us

You can do all below in any order you want, as much as you like

* Give us some feedback about non-clear documentation
* Give us some feedback about ~ridiculous~ overcomplicated contributing rules
* Tell us about typos on docs, ubiquitous language and/or code
* Tell us about inaccurate use of our own ubiquitous language - we are currently evolving it so it may change a bit
* Star `hubi` on github
* Provide us assets (images, gifs, wireframes, etc) to enhance something you think should be enhanced e.g. [HTML generated by the site translator](https://github.com/mvcds/hubi/issues/35)

* Tell your enemies about us if you've hated it - because they deserve some suffering!
