# Hubi [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mvcds/hubi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mvcds/hubi)

The ubiquitous language helper

## Getting started

### Installing

We recomend that `hubi` is installed in the target package with your favorite package manager, mine is `yarn`

```
yarn add hubi
```

You may also use `npm install hubi` to install `hubi`, the only important part is that it is a developer tool which yields source files, therefore we do not recomend to add it as a developer's depedency.
