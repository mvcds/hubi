> Teach `hubi` your [ubiquitous language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html) and it will write relevant source files for you

The humanitarian ubiquitous language helper, or `hubi` for short, reads your [domain files](https://mvcds.github.io/hubi/#domain-file) to learn the ubiquitous language behind your domain, and then generates relevant source files, so you don't have to manually change your [Joi Schemas](https://github.com/mvcds/hubi/issues/17), [Sequelize Models](https://github.com/mvcds/hubi/issues/26), [GraphQL types](https://github.com/mvcds/hubi/issues/27), [C# classes](https://github.com/mvcds/hubi/issues/28), etc.

:warning: currently, it only partially supports [joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi), and fully generates a site about your [ubiquitous langauge](https://mvcds.github.io/hubi/#ubiquitous-language)

:warning: For some reason, NPM is not showing the link to the [github repository](https://github.com/mvcds/hubi)

## Getting started

### Install

Use your favorite package manager to install `hubi` locally, mine is [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/).

```
yarn add hubi --dev
```

You may also use `npm` to install it, the only important part is that it should be installed with the developer flag, so packages depending on yours won't download it.

> In case you're working on a personal project, it is okay to have it installed globally but with teams, the ideal is that everyone is using the same version, thus a local installation is best recommended.

### Define an ubiquitous language

Teaching `hubi` your ubiquitous language is a matter of creating domain files (YAML). You can take a look at `hubi`'s own domain file as a [sample](src/Domain/Entities/DomainFile/domain-file.yml).

Let's pretend our ubiquitous language has a custumer [token](https://mvcds.github.io/hubi/#ubiquitous-token):

```yaml
# src/domain/entities/custumer.yml
name: Custumer
description: A person who has an account and therefore can buy stuff
attributes:
  - name: name
    description: How to address the person
    type: string # if type is ommited, then "string" is used
    required: true
  - name: email
    description: The external unique identifier of a custumer
    required: true
  ...
```

### Generate relevant source files

Add a new npm script to your `package.json`, so you can run it on a whim:

```json
{
  ...
  "hubi:log": "hubi save --pattern src/**/*.yml --output domain --translator log"
  ...
}
```

And from the command line call it to generate files you can use:

```shell
yarn hubi:log
```

## CLI

At the moment, `hubi` can only be used via command line, and thus you can script upon it.

### help

Show the commands bellow

### log

Logs the ubiquitous language entities to the console, in order to allow you to read it before saving it

* `--pattern | -p` is a glob pattern to your domain files, defaults to `src/**/*.yml`
* `--translator | -t` which [translator](https://mvcds.github.io/hubi/#translator) will be use to put the domain files into the console, defaults to `log`, a value used when developing the proof of concept but rather useless - at this version, a better choice for you is `site` or `joi`.
* `--verbose | -v` which allows debugging

### save

Saves the ubiquitous language entities into source files, the whole point of this project!

* the same arguments as `log`, plus
* `--output | -o` is the folder to which files will be saved, defaults to `domain`, it is literally a single folder at the moment üòû - in the future you should be able tell `hubi` where to save files with more precision

## More

### Dogfood

As a proof of concept, [`hubi`'s doc site](https://mvcds.github.io/hubi#all) is generated by `hubi` itself.

### Contributing

Showing the project to your peers is itself an amazing way of contribute but as `hubi` is an open-source project, you are also able to submit issues and pull requests. [Take a look at our contributing guide.](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Even **if you don't want to code**, you can always feedback us about non-clear documentation, showcase your domain and even inform us about bugs.

One of our most urgent needs are that we [miss useful Translators](https://github.com/mvcds/hubi/projects/2), so people may not use `hubi` because it does not attend their needs **yet**.

Improving the [HTML generated by the site translator](https://github.com/mvcds/hubi/issues/35) is also a wonderful initiative!

### For those who don't know/use [domain-driven design [DDD]](https://airbrake.io/blog/software-design/domain-driven-design)

I don‚Äôt know if Eric Evans, the author of domain-driven design book, coined the term ‚Äúubiquitous language‚Äù or if he only used it as his books‚Äôs initial seed. But I see *the-language-to-rule-them-all* as a communication tool that simply states that we should encode domain knowledge (terms, phrases, etc) into the codebase in order to bridge the gap between developers and domain-experts.

But you can still use ubiquitous language regardless of DDD, because it stands on its own. So, even if you don't know/use DDD you can still use `hubi` to reap the benefits of speaking a single language - at the same time you [document your code](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/06/21/documentation-as-code/).

### Should I pronounce the "h"?

No. The package name was supposed to be "ubi" (as in ubiquitous) but the name was already taken on npm, so I've used the only mute letter we have in Portuguese.

By pronouncing the "h" most Brazilians will never understand if you're referring to the Ruby programming language or this project. That sound ~~in that position~~ is not natural for us, so most of us simply can't tell "rot" and "hot", or "ruby" and "hubi", apart, for instance.
